About The Palisadoes Foundation
===============================

`talawa` code was created by the
[Palisadoes Foundation](http://www.palisadoes.org) as part of its annual
Calico Challenge program. Calico provides paid summer internships for
Jamaican university students to work on selected open source projects.
They are mentored by software professionals and receive stipends based
on the completion of predefined milestones. Calico was started in 2015.
